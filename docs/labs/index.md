## Labs
As part of the class, we are building a few labs in both SystemVerilog and Vitis HLS.
Unfortunately, we only have a few labs so far.  But, we will add more over the course of the
semester.

* [Unit 1: Pseudorandom number generation](./prng/)
   * Build a linear-feedback shift register in Python and SystemVerilog,
   and check that the two agree sample for sample.
* [Unit 2: Division with conditional subtraction](./subc/)
   * Implement a simple integer mathematical algorithm in SystemVerilog
   with a FSM and a handshake protocol.
* [Unit 3:  Fixed point implementation of a cubic function](./cubic/)
   * Implement a simple function in fixed point in SystemVerilog
   and validate against a python Golden model
* [Unit 4:  Root solver for a nonlinear function](./rootsolve/)
   * Implement a simple iterative root solver accelerator in Vitis HLS and optionally
   connect to a processor.
* [Unit 5:  Command-response mini-project](./cmdresp/)
   * Specify a streaming accelerator in the command-response pattern, and have
   an AI agent build it through C simulation, co-simulation and synthesis.
* [Unit 7:  Pipelined line intersection accelerator](./intersect/)
   * Build a simple intersection detector that can be used in physical and robotics simulations
