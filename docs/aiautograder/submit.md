# Submitting Your Answers on Gradescope

## Dashboard

If you select the **dashboard** box in the top right, you will be directed to
a dashboard page with a table of the problems and the points you have received
on each problem.  You can track your progress here.

## Submitting your answers for Gradescope

If you are an NYU student taking the class,  the **required** column indicates
if the problem is to be submitted for grading.  You should know how to do
all the problems for the midterm and final.  But, we only grade a subset.

Once you are satisfied with your results on the required problem, click the
**Download submission** button on the top right.  This selection will create a zip file with:

- A JSON file of the results on all submitted problems
- A text version of the file that can be read by a human grader, if there
is a dispute or clarification needed.

Now simply upload that zip file to gradescope.

## What happens next?

We are currently trying to write an autograder on Gradescope.  Hopefully, this program
will automatically read your results and grade you.
