# AI Autograder

As an experimental part of the course, I am playing around
with an LLM-based autograder.  If it is successful,
you will be able to enter solutions and get immediate
feedback from an advanced AI engine.  Right now, a barebones
autograder is on a server is hosted on [Render](https://llmgrader-e6o7.onrender.com).
As I am building the site, it may change and go off temporarily.

## Instructions

* [How to use the autograder](./howto.md)
* [OpenAI keys and mdoels](./openai.md)
* [Submitting work on Gradescope](./submit.md)

## Source Code and Feedback

The AI Autograder project is fully open-source -- you can check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sdrangan/llmgrader).  I would love to get your feedback, positive
or negative.  If there are features you would like, or errors you find, open an issue,
or send a pull request.
