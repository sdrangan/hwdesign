# Shared Memory Interface to the Processor

In the previous unit on [loop optimization](/fpgademos/loopopt/), we built and optimized a simple vector multiplier IP core.
We will now interconnect this IP to the PS.   In this unit, we consider a simple interconnection method based on shared memory.  Specifically, you will learn to:

* Add Vitis IP in a Vivado project that can read and write to external DDR memory
* Build and connect the memory interfaces with the AXI protocol
* Interact with the memory and Vitis IP from a jupyter notebook with PYNQ
