# Obtaining a License

The Vitis HLS tools are free, but you need to install a license.

After the installation, a window will open for *Vivado License Manager*.  I don't know how to bring up this window otherwise.

* Under **View System Information->View Host Information**":
    * Note the **hostname** and **Disk Serial number**. You will need these items later.
* Select **Get License->Obtain License**.  This will open a browser window
* In the broswer window, enter your contact information
* A **Product Licenses** Window will open.  Select the **Create New Licenses** tab and select **Vitis HLS license**  
* You should now have a license.
