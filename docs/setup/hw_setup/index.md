# Hardware Set-Up

While most of the demos should broadly apply to a range of FPGA boards, we will focus on two boards right now (we may add some other boards in the future):

* [**PYNQ-Z2**](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/university-program/aup-boards/pynq-z2.html):  A low-cost, easy-to-use board that we will use for teaching.  
* [**RFSoC 4x2**](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/university-program/aup-boards/rfsoc4x2.html):  A powerful, yet relatively low-cost, board for wireless communications with high-speeds ADCs.

In this chapter, we describe how to set-up the boards.
