# Software and Hardware Set-up

To use the material in the class, first follow our guid to [install software](./sw_installation/) including Vitis, Vivado, and various python packages.

You can conduct some of the class with just the software, including simulating all the circuits.  But, if you want to deploy the designs to an FPGA board,
you will need to select and FPGA board and [set-up the hardware](./hw_setup/).
