# Course Units

A tentative set of units is as follows.  I've only added a few units so far.
For all units, I will add lecture notes and problems.

* [Software and hardware set-up](./setup/)
* Unit 1:  Basic digital Logic
    * [Docs](./basic_logic/)
    * [SystemVerilog Examples:  Simple scalar functions](https://github.com/sdrangan/hwdesign/tree/main/demos/basic_logic)
    * Lecture  [to be added]
    * Problems [to be added]
* Unit 2:  Bus basics and memory-mapped interfaces
    * [Docs](./procif/)
    * [Vitis HLS Example:  Simple AXI4-Lite interface](https://github.com/sdrangan/hwdesign/tree/main/demos/scalar_fun)
    * Lecture [to be added]
    * Problems [to be added]
* Unit 3:  Command-response FIFO interfaces
    * [Docs](./fifoif/)
    * [Vitis HLS Example: Interfaces and AXI4-Streaming](./fifoif/)
* Unit 4:  Burst transfers and loop optimization
    * [Docs](./loopopt/)
* Unit 5:  Load-Compute-Store Pattern
