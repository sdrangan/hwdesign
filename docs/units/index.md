# Course Units

A tentative set of units is as follows.  I've only added a few units so far.
For all units, I will add lecture notes and problems.

* [Software and hardware set-up](./setup/)
* Unit 1:  Basic Digital Logic
    * [Demo:  Building simple scalar functions](./basic_logic/)
    * Lecture  [to be added]
    * Problems [to be added]
* Unit 2:  Bus basics and processor interfaces
    * [Demo:  Connecting an IP with AXI4-Lite](./scalar_fun/)
    * [Demo:  Deploying the IP on an FPGA](./procif/)
* Unit 3:  Command-response 
* [Unit 3:  Command-response FIFO interfaces and AXI4-Streaming](./fifoif/)
* [Unit 4:  Loop optimization](./loopopt/)
* Unit 5:  Load-Compute-Store Pattern
* Unit 6:  Data types and precision
* Unit 7:  Shared memory and the AXI4-Memory Map protocol
* Unit 8:  Building multi-threaded control
* Unit 9:  FIR Filters
* Unit 10:  Systolic Arrays
* Unit 11:  Convolutional networks
* Unit 12:  Dataflow and message-passing architectures
* Unit 13:  Interfacing with high-speed sample data
