"""grading — build steps that carry a score.

A lab is a :class:`~waveflow.build.build.BuildDag` whose nodes are
:class:`GradedStep`\\ s.  Each one does real work *and* grades it, writing a
small JSON record next to its other outputs.  A terminal :class:`GradeReportStep`
collects those records into the ``submitted_results.json`` that
`gradescope/autograde.py <../gradescope/autograde.py>`_ copies verbatim, plus the
zip the student uploads.

The student's loop is the DAG's::

    python prng_build.py --through prng_py     # score 5/10, and why
    python prng_build.py --through prng_sim    # ... and the next stage
    python prng_build.py                       # everything, then the zip

Why this lives in hwdesign and not waveflow: what a score *is* — partial credit,
Gradescope's JSON shape, the rule that a bad grade still lets the build continue
— is course policy.  Nothing here is useful to someone building hardware who is
not also teaching this class.

Three facts about ``BuildDag`` shape everything below; each is load-bearing.

1. **The DAG halts on the first failed step.**  So a low score must never raise.
   Grading failure and build failure are different things: the first is the
   point of the exercise, the second means the next step has nothing to read.
   :meth:`GradedStep.evaluate` should therefore catch the student's own errors
   and score them — :meth:`Checks.attempt` exists for exactly that.  An
   exception that escapes ``evaluate()`` is taken to mean the step could not
   produce its outputs, and does halt.

2. **A fresh step does not run.**  Freshness is decided from file mtimes before
   any step body executes, so on a second identical invocation ``evaluate()`` is
   never called.  This is why the score is written to disk rather than merely
   printed: the record survives the skip, and ``--grades`` reads it back.

3. **Everything in ``produces`` must be returned** or the DAG raises.  The eval
   record is in ``produces``, so it is written even on the failure path.
