"""labkit — publish a lab's public student tree from its annotated solution.

Instructor-side. The solution repository is private and is the source; the public
tree under ``hwdesign/labs/<lab>`` is a build output.  See ``plans/labkit.md``.

    labkit lint    labs/prng
    labkit publish labs/prng --dry-run
    labkit publish labs/prng

The student-side counterpart is ``StudentSourceStep`` in
:mod:`hwdesign.grading`, which copies a file up out of ``partial/`` the first
time a lab is built.
