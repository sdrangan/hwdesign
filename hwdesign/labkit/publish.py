"""publish — derive a lab's public tree from its annotated solution.

Reads ``lab.toml`` in the solution lab directory, classifies every file, and
writes the student tree::

    hwdesign-soln/labs/prng/tb_prng.sv  ->  hwdesign/labs/prng/tb_prng.sv

``partial/`` is where the redacted files land because a student's work sits at the
top level, where ``git pull`` cannot reach it.

The guards below all fail the publish rather than warning.  This tool writes into
a public git repository, and a repository's history is not something an apology
can fix.
